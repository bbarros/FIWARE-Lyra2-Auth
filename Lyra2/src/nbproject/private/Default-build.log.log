 
To build Lyra2, type:
      make OPTION [nCols=(number of columns, default 64)]
 
where OPTION can be one of the following:
generic-x86-64                      For x86-64 Unix-like system, with gcc (i.e., Linux, FreeBSD, Mac OS, etc.)
linux-x86-64-sse2                   Linux x86-64, with SSE2 (beta version, needs improvement)
linux-x86-64-cuda                   Linux x86-64 (native), with CUDA (experimental)
linux-x86-64-cuda-tested-arch       Linux x86-64 (native), with CUDA (on architecture where the tests were performed)
windows-x86-64                      Windows x86-64, Cygwin
win-cygwin-x86-64-sse2              Windows x86-64, Cygwin, with SSE2 (beta version, needs improvement)
 
Notes:
Lyra2 was tested with nCols=16, nCols=32, nCols=64, nCols=96, and nCols=128 
This implementation is known to have issues for large memory usage. The maximum tested memory usage was 1.6 GB
